# Unit Conversion
A standard Unit converter to be built with JavaFX. This project is designed to allow for one unit to be converted in one or many steps by traversing a graph of possible conversions.

The program returns the converted value by either finding the target unit directly connected by a function to convert, or by using Breadth-First Search to continually convert to all connected nodes until the target unit is found.
